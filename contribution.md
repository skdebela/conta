# Contribution Guidelines

## Branching

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix to keeps the main branch clean and stable.
  
  Example:
  - `feature/add-contact`
  - `bugfix/remove-contact`

## Commits

- Write concise but descriptive commit messages:

## Pull Requests

- After making your changes and testing them locally, push the branch to the remote repository.
  
- Once your branch is pushed, open a pull request on GitHub to merge it into the main branch.

- Request a review from at least one team member before merging.

## Test locally and merge

For minor changes or if you are sure about your change, you can just merge and push to main yourself.

- After you are done making your changes in the feature branch, commit all work and switch to `main` branch
- Pull the latest `main` branch from remote to sync
- Merge your feature branch to `main`
- Test locally to make sure everything is working as expected
- Push to remote if you are sure about your changes and all tests are passed
